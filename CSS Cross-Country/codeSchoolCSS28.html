        <p>Since 1989, perfection every time.</p>
        <p>Sven's Snowshoe Emporium was founded in 1989 by Sven Jacobssen, a man with a passion for trudging through unsafe surfaces. Since the time he was a small child, Sven dreamed of building an emporium to house the magical shoes that made his hobby possible. Believing in supporting his small community, and fearing travel, it only made sense to build this snowshoe mecca in his hometown of Wenatchee, Washington. Since 1989, Sven's has grown tremendously, drawing snow enthusiasts from across the nation and worldwide.</p>
        <p>Today, Sven's is operated by Sven and his 4 daughters, Sofia, Sassa, Solvig, and Svanhilda. Stop by anytime Monday thru Saturday from 9am to 6pm, and join the Sven's Snowshoe Emporium family.</p>
